Demonstration of SciTeX Developer Support MCP Server capabilities.

This example shows how the developer server can help with:
- Test generation
- Performance analysis
- Code quality assessment
- Migration planning
- Interactive learning
"""

# Example 1: Test Generation
print("=== Test Generation Example ===")
print("""
Request: "Generate comprehensive tests for my data analysis script"

The developer server will:
1. Analyze your script to identify testable components
2. Generate appropriate test cases using pytest or unittest
3. Create fixtures for common test scenarios
4. Include both unit tests and integration tests
5. Provide test coverage analysis

Example output:
- test_data_analysis.py with 15 test cases
- Coverage report showing 85% coverage
- Suggestions for improving test coverage
""")

# Example 2: Performance Optimization
print("\n=== Performance Optimization Example ===")
print("""
Request: "Benchmark my script and create optimization plan for 2x speedup"

The developer server will:
1. Profile your script for time and memory usage
2. Identify performance bottlenecks
3. Suggest specific optimizations with expected impact
4. Create a phased optimization roadmap
5. Provide before/after performance comparisons

Example optimization plan:
- Phase 1: Add caching (1.5x speedup)
- Phase 2: Vectorize operations (2x speedup)
- Phase 3: Parallel processing (3x speedup)
""")

# Example 3: Migration Assistance
print("\n=== Migration Assistance Example ===")
print("""
Request: "Help me migrate from SciTeX 1.0 to 2.0"

The developer server will:
1. Analyze your codebase for version-specific features
2. Identify breaking changes between versions
3. Generate automated migration scripts
4. Highlight code requiring manual updates
5. Create a step-by-step migration plan

Example migration plan:
- Backup current project
- Update dependencies
- Run automated migration
- Fix 3 manual issues identified
- Run tests to verify
""")

# Example 4: Code Quality Analysis
print("\n=== Code Quality Analysis Example ===")
print("""
Request: "Analyze code quality metrics for my project"

The developer server will:
1. Calculate complexity metrics (cyclomatic, cognitive)
2. Assess maintainability and testability
3. Check documentation coverage
4. Identify security issues
5. Provide overall quality score with grade

Example quality report:
- Complexity: 85/100 (Low complexity)
- Maintainability: 78/100 (Good structure)
- Documentation: 65/100 (Needs improvement)
- Overall Grade: B
""")

# Example 5: Interactive Learning
print("\n=== Interactive Learning Example ===")
print("""
Request: "Explain SciTeX configuration system with exercises"

The developer server will:
1. Provide concept explanation at your level
2. Show practical examples
3. Create interactive exercises
4. Highlight common mistakes
5. Suggest best practices

Example tutorial sections:
- Understanding CONFIG structure
- Creating configuration files
- Accessing parameters in code
- Exercise: Convert hardcoded values
- Quiz: Configuration best practices
""")

# Example 6: Comprehensive Project Intelligence
print("\n=== Project Intelligence Example ===")
print("""
Request: "Generate comprehensive intelligence report for my project"

The developer server combines all analysis capabilities:
1. Semantic structure analysis
2. Dependency mapping and visualization
3. Performance characteristics
4. Research workflow patterns
5. Architectural insights
6. Strategic recommendations

This provides a complete understanding of your project's:
- Current state and health
- Optimization opportunities
- Evolution roadmap
- Quality improvements
""")

# Example workflow combining multiple features
print("\n=== Complete Development Workflow ===")
print("""
A typical development session might use multiple tools:

1. Start with project analysis:
   "Analyze my neuroscience data processing project"
   
2. Generate missing tests:
   "Generate tests for uncovered functions"
   
3. Optimize performance:
   "Create optimization plan for signal processing pipeline"
   
4. Ensure quality:
   "Check code quality and suggest refactoring"
   
5. Prepare for deployment:
   "Assess publication readiness and documentation"

The developer server acts as your AI pair programmer, helping at every stage!

print("\n=== How the Developer Server Helps ===")
print("""
For the above code, the developer server would:

1. TESTING: Generate comprehensive test suite
   - Test normal cases, edge cases, errors
   - Create fixtures for test data
   - Achieve 95%+ coverage

2. PERFORMANCE: Identify optimizations
   - Replace loop with vectorized operation (10x faster)
   - Add caching for expensive operations
   - Profile memory usage

3. QUALITY: Suggest improvements
   - Extract hardcoded values to CONFIG
   - Add proper error handling
   - Improve function documentation

4. MIGRATION: Convert to SciTeX patterns
   - Use stx.io.load() instead of pd.read_csv()
   - Add @stx.io.cache() decorator
   - Follow SciTeX conventions

The result: Faster, more maintainable, well-tested code!
