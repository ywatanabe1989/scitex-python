"""SciTeX Writer - LaTeX manuscript compilation system.

This module provides a thin wrapper around scitex-writer, the core manuscript
compilation package. It uses scitex branding and environment variable prefixes.

Features
--------
- LaTeX manuscript compilation
- Supplementary materials compilation
- Revision response compilation with change tracking
- BibTeX management
- Figure/table management
- Writing guidelines

Usage
-----
    import scitex as stx

    # Create or attach to a project
    writer = stx.writer.Writer("my_paper")

    # Compile manuscript
    result = writer.compile_manuscript()
    if result.success:
        print(f"PDF created: {result.output_pdf}")

    # Compile supplementary
    result = writer.compile_supplementary()

    # Compile revision with change tracking
    result = writer.compile_revision(track_changes=True)
