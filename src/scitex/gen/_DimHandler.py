"""
This script demonstrates DimHandler, which:
1) Keeps designated dimensions,
2) Permutes the kept dimensions to the last while maintaining their relative order,
3) Reshapes the remaining dimensions to the first, batch dimension,
4) (Performs calculations),
5) Restores the summarized dimensions to their original shapes.

# Functions
class DimHandler:
    """
    A utility class for handling dimension manipulations on tensors or arrays, including reshaping and permuting dimensions.

    Attributes:
        orig_shape (tuple): The original shape of the input tensor or array before any manipulation.
        keepdims (list): The list of dimensions to be kept and moved to the end.
        n_non_keepdims (list): The sizes of the dimensions not kept, used for reshaping back to the original shape.
        n_keepdims (list): The sizes of the kept dimensions, used for reshaping.

    Example1:
        import torch

        dh = DimHandler()
        x = torch.rand(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)  # Example tensor
        print(x.shape)  # torch.Size([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
        x = dh.fit(x, keepdims=[0, 2, 5])
        print(x.shape)  # torch.Size([40, 1, 3, 6])
        x = dh.unfit(x)
        print(x.shape)  # torch.Size([2, 4, 5, 1, 3, 6])

    Example 2:
        import torch

        dh = DimHandler()
        x = torch.rand(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)  # Example tensor

        print(y.shape) # torch.Size([40, 1, 6])
        y = dh.unfit(y)
