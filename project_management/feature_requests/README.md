# Feature Requests

This directory contains feature requests for the SciTeX project, organized according to their implementation status.

## Directory Structure

- `./feature_requests/` - Active feature requests that are currently being implemented or planned
- `./feature_requests/solved/` - Completed feature requests that have been implemented and integrated

## Feature Request Format

Each feature request should follow this format:

```markdown
# Feature Request: <title>

## Description
Brief description of the feature

## Requirements
List of specific requirements for the feature

## Implementation Plan
Step-by-step plan for implementing the feature

## Success Criteria
Criteria to determine when the feature is successfully implemented

## Resources
Any resources needed or helpful for implementation

## Progress
- [x] Completed task 1
- [x] Completed task 2
- [ ] Pending task 3
- [ ] Pending task 4
```

## Workflow

1. Create new feature requests in the `./feature_requests/` directory
2. Track progress by updating the Progress section in the feature request file
3. Once a feature is fully implemented, move it to the `./feature_requests/solved/` directory
4. Create a corresponding implementation summary if needed

## Notes

The feature requests in this directory have been reorganized to follow this new structure. Some older feature requests may still exist in the parent directory until they can be properly moved.
