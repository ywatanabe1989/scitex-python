**Figure 3.** Comprehensive signal analysis demonstrating time-domain, frequency-domain, statistical, and correlational perspectives of the experimental data. (A) Exponentially damped sinusoidal signal with 10 Hz fundamental frequency and τ = 0.5 s decay constant. (B) Power spectral density revealing the dominant frequency component and harmonic structure. (C) Histogram of signal amplitudes showing normal distribution with μ = 50 mV, σ = 10 mV. (D) Strong linear correlation (R² = 0.89) between predictor and response variables with 2.5:1 slope.
